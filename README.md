# CSSmokes
CSSmokes is a website with all your CSGO needs. With tutorials, tips and guides that will help you get better at the game. The website contains guides to all known smokes in all 7 competitive maps in CSGO.

Initally, I started this website just to learn how to code and experience it first hand. Half way through writing the website, I decided that I will create a domain for it and release it for all my friends to use it. 

As the game evolves, there were new tricks getting introduced and I was updating the website day by day.
